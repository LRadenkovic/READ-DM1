# READ-DM1
READ-DM1 is a national biomedical project conducted at the University of Belgrade – Faculty of Biology, led by Prof. Dušanka Savić-Pavićević. The project aims to enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of individual differences in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and improve the prediction of disease progression.

To support this research, the STRat pipeline was developed as a specialized tool for analyzing project-generated data. STRat enables the determination of repeat numbers and their structural characteristics in STR expansions.

This research was funded by the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia, grant #7754217, READ-DM1.
